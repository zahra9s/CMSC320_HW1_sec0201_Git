Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We might consider using Git because it will help us work efficiently for this class’s group project, as it allows multiple people to contribute to a codebase. Git also saves and lets us access previous versions of our code, so if we make a change and it doesn’t work as expected, we can revert to a previous version.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to the healthcare field. For example, data science can be used to track COVID-related data, such as which states have the highest number of cases, which demographics are most affected, and how many patients are being admitted to the hospital due to COVID.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: The difference between merging and rebasing is that merging allows us to combine two branches together, while rebasing replays or reapplies your commits on top of the latest branch. 

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I’m looking forward to learning more about SQL and Pandas in this class because I hope to implement them in future personal projects.
